# crowdflower

Client library for interacting with the [CrowdFlower](http://www.crowdflower.com/) [API](http://success.crowdflower.com/customer/portal/articles/1288323-api-documentation) with Python.


## Installation

Install from PyPI:

    easy_install -U crowdflower

Or install the latest version from GitHub:

    git clone https://github.com/peoplepattern/crowdflower.git
    cd crowdflower
    python setup.py develop


## Basic usage

Import like:

    import crowdflower

CrowdFlower API keys are 20 characters long; the one below is just random
characters. (You can find your API key at
[make.crowdflower.com/account/user](https://make.crowdflower.com/account/user).)

    conn = crowdflower.Connection(api_key='LbcxvIlE3x1M8F6TT5hN')

The library will default to an environment variable called `CROWDFLOWER_API_KEY` if
none is specified here:

    conn = crowdflower.Connection()

If you want to cache job responses, like judgments, properties, and tags, you
can initialize the connection with a cache. `cache='filesystem'` is the only
option currently supported, and serializes JSON files to `/tmp/crowdflower/*`.

    conn = crowdflower.Connection(cache='filesystem')


## Inspecting existing jobs

Loop through all your jobs and print the titles:

    for job in conn.jobs():
        print job.properties['title']


## Creating a new job

Create a new job with some new units:

    data = [
        {'id': '1', 'name': 'Chris Narenz', 'gender_gold': 'male'},
        {'id': '2', 'name': 'George Henckels'},
        {'id': '3', 'name': 'Maisy Ester'},
    ]
    job = conn.upload(data)
    update_result = job.update({
        'title': 'Gender labels',
        'included_countries': ['US', 'GB'],  # Limit to the USA and United Kingdom
            # Please note, if you are located in another country and you would like
            # to experiment with the sandbox (internal workers) then you also need
            # to add your own country. Otherwise your submissions as internal worker
            # will be rejected with Error 301 (low quality).
        'payment_cents': 5,
        'judgments_per_unit': 2,
        'instructions': 'some <i>instructions</i> html',
        'cml': 'some layout cml, e.g., '
            '<cml:text label="Sample text field:" validates="required" />',
        'options': {
            'front_load': 1, # quiz mode = 1; turn off with 0
        }
    })

    if 'errors' in update_result:
        print(update_result['errors'])
        exit()

    job.gold_add('gender', 'gender_gold')

Launch job for on-demand workers (the default):

    job.launch(2)

Launch job for internal workers (sandbox):

    job.launch(2, channels=['cf_internal'])

Check the status of the job:

    print job.ping()

Clean up; delete all the jobs that were created by the above example:

    for job in conn.jobs():
        if job.properties['title'] == 'Gender labels':
            print 'Deleting Job#%s' % job.id
            print job.delete()

View annotations collected so far:

    for row in job.download():
        print row


## Example

See the `README.md` in the [`examples/`](https://github.com/peoplepattern/crowdflower/tree/master/examples) directory for a full spam classification example using the freely available [SMS Spam Collection](http://www.dt.fee.unicamp.br/~tiago/smsspamcollection/).


## Debugging / Logging

To turn on verbose logging use the following in your script:

    import logging
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)


## Motivation

The official [Ruby client](https://github.com/CrowdFlower/ruby-crowdflower) is hard to use, which is surprising, since the CrowdFlower API is so simple.

Which is not to say the [CrowdFlower API](http://success.crowdflower.com/customer/portal/articles/1288323-api-documentation) is all ponies and rainbows, but all the documentation is there on one page, and it does what it says, for the most part. (Though there's more that you can do, beyond what's documented.)

Thus, a thin Python client for the CrowdFlower API.
