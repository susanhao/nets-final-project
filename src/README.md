QC Module
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The QC module parses the Crowdflower csv file such that we can extract the worker ids, the
gold answers(the answers we use to check for quality), and the crowd's answers to our gold questions.
This module also keeps track of the winning rap by counting the total votes of each rap.

Aggregation Module
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Aggregation Module parses the Crowdflower csv file such that we can extract certain data
from Crowdflower.  We can thus extract the rap theme, description, and the rap lines that the
crowd has provided.
