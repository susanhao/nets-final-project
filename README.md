Make-A-Rap

"Make-A-Rap‚Äù will effectively crowd-source raps based on any theme a requester decides to post. We will determine if it is possible for a random group of individuals to cooperatively create an effective and aesthetically pleasing rap.

Flow Chart

First, we will design the HIT and web app to support it . This will include a portal that asks if you would like to request a theme or contribute to ongoing raps. The requester page will prompt the user to write down the theme of the rap that they would like to write. From experience, good raps come from writing a descriptive story, then rewrite it in song line by line, therefore we will have a text box for people to write what they want their rap to be about. Then, the requester will be able to set a voting threshold (default: 20 up votes) for the submissions (this will make sense in a second), and a limit to how long they want the rap to be (number of lines).The contributor page will have a list of ongoing rap projects. Contributors can go to a random one or click a title that looks promising (perhaps something they can provide experience to). The page containing the actual rap will show the rap in progress, have a place to vote for each line, indicate which lines are final, and a place to add a line.

Then, we will begin initial recruitment by asking friends and acquaintances to participate in the HIT via social media and unofficial word of mouth advertisement, possibly setting up a table on locust walk to pull contributors and gauge their experience. (1)

Then, we will aggregate the crowd-sourced input. Each requestor gets to have one theme at a time, so as to prevent overload of themes. When the contributor is on the page of a specific rap, they are allowed to add one line/couplet (140 characters or less). This will be added to the possible candidates for a given line/couplet. The contributor is then allowed to vote up or vote down possible candidates for each line. If the up votes for a line reach the threshold, then that line is permanently in place (there is no way of changing it). If the down votes reach the negative threshold, then that candidate is thrown out and no long considered a possible line. This will proceed until the rap reaches the the limit length and all lines are permanently in place.

We enforce quality control on the quality of the contributers. The user names will be reported next to winning lines. The users with the most amount of winning lines will belong to a hall of fame.
Milestones

Build the interface pages to the user (4). This will take the most work since we have to build a webpage, including ways how users to interact with it, how it collects user input, and how the user input (rap suggestions, votes, etc.) are displayed on the screen
Recruit the crowd (1). This will be easiest to accomplish. We will start with our closest friends, then extend further out upon success in the smaller groups.
Aggregation of results (3). This will be done by ensuring that rap lines are made permament when enough users upvote these lines.
Quality control (3). We are still unsure how to control for quality of results other than providing the incentive structure we have already (upvotes for popular lines; and recognition for posting popular lines). We will need to test out how this works and discover based on the input where the pitfalls are.
Incentivization (2). We are at ends who will be posting requests to get crowd-sourced raps and who will be contributing and if there will be a balance of the two. We will develop the incentive structure of the cite as we discover more issues like these that prevent people from interacting with the cite.
