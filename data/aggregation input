Chicago	  "I'm looking for a rap about Chicago.                       	N/A
          Chicago has a lot of things like the Willis
          Tower, the tallest building in the united states,
          the chicago cubs, a baseball team who hasn't won 
          the world series in over 100 years. It is known as 
          the Windy City. Idk, I just need something I can rap 
          about to my friends."
